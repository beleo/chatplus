  "readme": "# Fork of MailParser\ntweaking [mailparser](https://github.com/nodemailer/mailparser) to work on node 4\n\n[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/farskipper/mailparser.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/farskipper/mailparser)\n\nAdvanced email parser for Node.js. Everything is handled as a stream which should make it able to parse even very large messages (100MB+) with relatively low overhead.\n\nThe module exposes two separate modes, a lower level `MailParser` class and `simpleParser` function. The latter is simpler to use (hence the name) but is less resource efficient as it buffers attachment contents in memory.\n\nFor older version of MailParser see the docs [here](https://github.com/andris9/mailparser/blob/b8488c5b6a73920b58bcd2f62a5c3be115940fe4/README.md)\n\n> This module is part of the [Nodemailer bundle](https://nodemailer.com/about/pricing/). Starting from v2.0.0 MailParser is licensed under the [European Union Public License 1.1](http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/eupl.html). In general, EUPLv1.1 is a _copyleft_ license compatible with GPLv2, so if you're OK using GPL then you should be OK using MailParser. Previous versions of MailParser are licensed under the MIT license.\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install mailparser\n```\n\n## simpleParser\n\n`simpleParser` is the easiest way to parse emails. You only need to provide a message source to get a parsed email structure in return. As an additional bonus all embedded images in HTML (eg. the images that point to attachments using cid: URIs) are replaced with base64 encoded data URIs, so the message can be displayed without any additional processing. Be aware though that this module does not do any security cleansing (eg. removing javascript and so on), this is left to your own application.\n\n```javascript\nconst simpleParser = require('mailparser').simpleParser;\nsimpleParser(source, (err, mail)=>{})\n```\n\nor as a Promise:\n\n```javascript\nsimpleParser(source).then(mail=>{}).catch(err=>{})\n```\n\nWhere\n\n- **source** is either a stream, a Buffer or a string that needs to be parsed\n- **err** is the possible error object\n- **mail** is a structured email object\n\n### mail object\n\nParsed `mail` object has the following properties\n\n- **headers** â€“ a Map object with lowercase header keys\n- **subject** is the subject line (also available from the header `mail.headers.get('subject')`)\n- **from** is an address object for the From: header\n- **to** is an address object for the To: header\n- **cc** is an address object for the Cc: header\n- **bcc** is an address object for the Bcc: header (usually not present)\n- **date** is a Date object for the Date: header\n- **messageId** is the Message-ID value string\n- **inReplyTo** is the In-Reply-To value string\n- **reply-to** is an address object for the Cc: header\n- **references** is an array of referenced Message-ID values\n- **html** is the HTML body of the message. If the message included embedded images as cid: urls then these are all replaced with base64 formatted data: URIs\n- **text** is the plaintext body of the message\n- **textAsHtml** is the plaintext body of the message formatted as HTML\n- **attachments** is an array of attachments\n\n### address object\n\nAddress objects have the following structure:\n\n- **value** an array with address details\n\n  - **name** is the name part of the email/group\n  - **address** is the email address\n  - **group** is an array of grouped addresses\n\n- **text** is a formatted address string for plaintext context\n\n- **html** is a formatted address string for HTML context\n\n**Example**\n\n```javascript\n{\n    value: [\n        {\n            address: 'andris+123@kreata.ee',\n            name: 'Andris Reinman'\n        },\n        {\n            address: 'andris.reinman@gmail.com',\n            name: ''\n        }\n    ],\n    html: '<span class=\"mp_address_name\">Andris Reinman</span> <<a href=\"mailto:andris+123@kreata.ee\" class=\"mp_address_email\">andris+123@kreata.ee</a>>, <a href=\"mailto:andris.reinman@gmail.com\" class=\"mp_address_email\">andris.reinman@gmail.com</a>',\n    text: 'Andris Reinman <andris+123@kreata.ee>, andris.reinman@gmail.com'\n}\n```\n\n### headers Map\n\n`headers` is a Map with lowercase header keys. So if you want to check for the Subject: header then you can do it like this:\n\n```javascript\nif (mail.headers.has('subject')) {\n    console.log(mail.headers.get('subject'));\n}\n```\n\nThe format of a header depends on the specific key. For most header keys the value is either a string (a single header) or an array of strings (multiple headers with the same key were found).\n\nSpecial header keys are the following:\n\n1. All address headers are converted into address objects\n\n  - **from**\n  - **to**\n  - **cc**\n  - **bcc**\n  - **sender**\n  - **reply-to**\n  - **delivered-to**\n  - **return-path**\n\n2. All different priority headers are converted into **priority** with the following values:\n\n  - **'high'**\n  - **'normal'**\n  - **'low'**\n\n3. **references** is a string if only a single reference-id exists or an array if multiple ids exist\n\n4. **date** value is a Date object\n5. The following headers are parsed into structured objects, where `value` property includes the main value as string and `params` property holds an object of additional arguments as key-value pairs\n\n  - **content-type**\n  - **content-disposition**\n  - **dkim-signature**\n\nSome headers are also automaticaly mime-word decoded\n\n- all address headers (name parts and punycode encoded domains are converted to unicode)\n- **subject** is converted to unicode\n\n### attachment object\n\nAttachment objects have the following structure:\n\n- **filename** (if available) file name of the attachment\n- **contentType** MIME type of the message\n- **contentDisposition** content disposition type for the attachment, most probably \"attachment\"\n- **checksum** a MD5 hash of the message content\n- **size** message size in bytes\n- **headers** a Map value that holds MIME headers for the attachment node\n- **content** a Buffer that contains the attachment contents\n- **contentId** the header value from 'Content-ID' (if present)\n- **cid** contentId without < and >\n- **related** if true then this attachment should not be offered for download (at least not in the main attachments list)\n\n## MailParser\n\n`MailParser` is a lower-level email parsing class. It is a transform stream that takes email source as bytestream for the input and emits data objects for attachments and text contents.\n\n```javascript\nconst MailParser = require('mailparser').MailParser;\nlet parser = new MailParser()\n```\n\n### Event 'headers'\n\nThe parser emits 'headers' once message headers have been processed. The headers object is a Map. Different header keys have different kind of values, for example address headers have the address object/array as the value while subject value is string.\n\nHeader keys in the Map are lowercase.\n\n```javascript\nparser.on('headers', headers = {\n    console.log(headers.get('subject'));\n});\n```\n\n### Event 'data'\n\nEvent 'data' or 'readable' emits message content objects. The type of the object can be determine by the `type` property. Currently there are two kind of data objects\n\n- 'attachment' indicates that this object is an attachment\n- 'text' indicates that this object includes the html and text parts of the message. This object is emitted once and it includes both values\n\n### attachment object\n\nAttachment object is the same as in `simpleParser` except that `content` is not a buffer but a stream. Additionally there's a method `release()` that must be called once you have processed the attachment. The property `related` is set after message processing is ended, so at the `data` event this value is not yet available.\n\n```javascript\nparser.on('data', data => {\n    if(data.type === 'attachment'){\n        console.log(data.filename);\n        data.content.pipe(process.stdout);\n        data.content.on('end', ()=>data.release());\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIf you do not call `release()` then the message processing is paused.\n\n### text object\n\nText object has the following keys:\n\n- **text** includes the plaintext version of the message. Is set if the message has at least one 'text/plain' node\n- **html** includes the HTML version of the message. Is set if the message has at least one 'text/html' node\n- **textAsHtml** includes the plaintext version of the message in HTML format. Is set if the message has at least one 'text/plain' node.\n\n```javascript\nparser.on('data', data => {\n    if(data.type === 'text'){\n        console.log(data.html);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n## Issues\n\nCharset decoding is handled using [iconv-lite](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite) that is missing some charsets, especially some Japanese ones. If required then it would be possible to switch to native iconv bindings with [node-iconv](https://github.com/bnoordhuis/node-iconv) to handle these missing charsets but for now this option is not used for easier packaging.\n\n## License\n\nEuropean Union Public License 1.1\\.
